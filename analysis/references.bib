              genomic understanding of ER function has been restricted to model
              systems. Here we map genome-wide ER-binding events, by chromatin
              immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing

              different clinical outcomes and in distant ER-positive

              to the chromatin, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with
              the acquisition of unique ER-binding regions in tumours from
              patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired ER regulatory
              regions associated with poor clinical outcome observed in primary

              and FOXA1 binding events in drug-resistant cellular contexts is
              supported by histological co-expression of ER and FOXA1 in
              metastatic samples. By establishing transcription-factor mapping

              similar median values across samples, but these fail to reduce
              other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such as

              across samples to be the same and assume global differences in

              However, it remains unclear how to proceed with normalization if

              We created standardized reference datasets by in silico
